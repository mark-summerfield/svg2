_Pre-alpha software, work in progress, nothing actually works yet!_

_Prior to version 1.0.0 the API is completely unstable._

A pure Python library for creating, editing, and rendering SVG images.

The only dependencies are Python's standard library.

However, `svg2` will make use of superior third-party libraries when they
are available.

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/svg2/

Install:
```
python3 -m pip install svg2
````
